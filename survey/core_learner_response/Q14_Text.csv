10,Jun 13 2017 02:54 PM,"It's difficult to combine a full-time job and a maintain an open source project. It's not only a matter the financial support. Oftentimes you need to answer and address questions from the community which are put in a very demanding way. People don't realize what an open source project is and the role of a typical maintainer.
