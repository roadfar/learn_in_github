48,Jun 07 2017 09:46 PM,"I am primarily a .Net developer so I use Visual Studio.  Although I can use command line tools to use Git and there is Git support for VS it is not as convenient as other source control for this environment.  I feel that the Git style is a better SC so it would be nice to have a better interface to sync/get/push/etc.  The VS Git interface is lacking (not your fault), the windows interface you provide is cumbersome and it is preferable to just learn the command line at that point which is also cumbersome.  I would not even want to attempt to do some of the merges I have done recently in command line, however rebase would solve most of that issue (rebase does not exist in TFS).  And SVN is just the worst of both worlds.",

58,Jun 07 2017 08:48 PM,Never tried any,
59,Jun 07 2017 08:32 PM,I'm not entirely sure. The line of questioning seems hyper focused on GitHub when the concept of online learning is not limited to GitHub itself. Any challenge or problem encountered would be the same irregardless of the company/project that hosts the content.,
