1,Jun 10 2017 01:43 PM,I think the best way to learn in github is to work with project main contributors and getting feedback from them.,
2,Jun 10 2017 12:15 PM,"In China, people always will say that hope you better!",
3,Jun 09 2017 10:34 PM,:) you guys are great,

8,Jun 07 2017 10:00 PM,I want a sticker of octocat,
9,Jun 07 2017 09:47 PM,You already have to be familiar with what you're learning about. Like I went through the Ruby Koans and the Lisp Koans but they wouldn't have been useful unless I was already programming in those languages or if I wasn't familiar with software testing.,
10,Jun 07 2017 09:46 PM,"Please do not take the above as a negative review.  I love the tools on your site such as gitter, gist, and the PR tools.",
11,Jun 07 2017 09:44 PM,"I've learnt a lot within 2 years of using github that i never learnt from any leaning environment. Keep the good work guys, i am stuck with you guyz for life :) ",
12,Jun 07 2017 09:40 PM,It's all fun. It's one of the best thing that ever happened to me.,
13,Jun 07 2017 09:27 PM,I really enjoy seeing how the platform has matured and has influenced many other products to try to implement features first found in Github. I've learned more in my free time through projects and documentation on github technically than in a previous job I was employed in for 3 years,
14,Jun 07 2017 09:22 PM,I think it should go in the direction of stackoverflow documentation feature,
15,Jun 07 2017 09:06 PM,Thank you github!!,
16,Jun 07 2017 08:55 PM,Thanks for providing us with this great site.,
17,Jun 07 2017 08:55 PM,"GitHub is not a learning platform after all. It's its versatility which allows us to use it as one, but please let's not cram features into highly-focused product, because we'll just end with yet another Facebook as the result.",
18,Jun 07 2017 08:48 PM,I have never tried GitHub learning - I am going to go there now to check it out!,
19,Jun 07 2017 08:32 PM,"The survey felt dispaportional to my use case. I saw a project that looked neat and simply forked it. Maybe played with it for a few hours and then moved on. It wasn't like I actively was seeking out course material on GitHub. Personally, I think GitHub should be part of supporting material. Or possibly just host the main learning material. But the impact is nothing more then a hosting service not a means to facilitate learning.",
20,Jun 07 2017 08:00 PM,Thanks. I love github. ,
21,Jun 07 2017 07:14 PM,It's awesome.,
22,Jun 07 2017 06:33 PM,please provide students some means like a video on complete guidance on usage of Github. Github is bit confusing. <3 to github from india. :),
23,Jun 07 2017 06:31 PM,Learning from GitHub is like learning from world's best teachers.,
24,Jun 07 2017 05:51 PM,Github has helped me gain knowledge and share my ideas with others.,

38,Jun 05 2017 12:44 AM,Teach me please anything,
39,Jun 04 2017 08:29 PM,"I generally learn through a website that is also connected to github, so that i learn the course material and enact it on a github.  there is a cross between the worlds where that content is stored for me.  github is where i go to find answers about issues i cannot solve readily on my own, or to be inspired by a repository i appreciate.  ",
40,Jun 04 2017 07:01 PM,Can you give me a girl friendï¼Ÿ,

43,Jun 03 2017 11:27 PM,"Sometimes are not updated enough.
Sometimes could use links to other projects or lessons to learn more (references).",
44,Jun 03 2017 10:24 PM,"As an act of shameless self-promotion, i helped organizing a bunch of less popular github-based courses lately, namely
https://github.com/yandexdataschool/practical_rl/
https://github.com/yandexdataschool/HSE_deeplearning/",

49,Jun 03 2017 04:00 PM,Love using the product. Keep up the good work!,
50,Jun 03 2017 02:34 PM,"I can't tell if this is about freecodecamp or the free course I took to learn Git. Please be more clear about what the survey is about, write a shorter survey and be less leading with your answers",
51,Jun 03 2017 01:32 PM,Thanks to everyone who is engaged in the process of creating the platform for education.,
52,Jun 03 2017 01:17 PM,"I think you could work in following learning process.
1. I go to GitHub, fork existing learning repository
2. When I have to accomplish task by give PR to my repository.
3. When Travis or other build tool perform check of my assignment
4. After it is succeed it mark task as completed somewhere.",
53,Jun 03 2017 01:09 PM,I love it!!!!,
54,Jun 03 2017 12:22 PM,should be some kind of IA that help to know what are the wrong answers.,

59,Jun 03 2017 10:31 AM,"I think I was sent this because I'm on the awesome deep learning or vision boards. I use those primarily to find research and as a quick reference, not really to learn anything. I've seen a lot of self promotion recently (researchers posting their own research) which is kinda annoying.",
60,Jun 03 2017 10:30 AM,Many great developers put great articles as will pages in GitHub,
61,Jun 03 2017 10:28 AM,"I have been using Free Code Camp and Udacity, and sometimes my own with other educational materials to create these projects.  One of the questions didn't really apply to me.  I graduated with Ph.D. in 2012 and started using Github about 2 years.  Thank you for a wonderful experience!",
62,Jun 03 2017 10:21 AM,I really appreciate GitHub and the learning project owners/contributors for making such a fantastic tool to help people learn various topics. It was an engaging experience to be able to learn through interactive lessons instead of watching videos or reading tutorials. I look forward to trying the learning project again when it offers advanced materials that aims to help the person become a master/professional at the topic.,
63,Jun 03 2017 10:19 AM,learning here is great when i saw the platform for the first time i was too happy because you help me in any questions,
