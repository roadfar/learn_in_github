Although I can use command line tools to use Git and there is Git support for VS it is not as convenient as other source control for this environment.  I feel that the Git style is a better SC so it would be nice to have a better interface to sync/get/push/etc.  The VS Git interface is lacking (not your fault), the windows interface you provide is cumbersome and it is preferable to just learn the command line at that point which is also cumbersome.  I would not even want to attempt to do some of the merges I have done recently in command line, however rebase would solve most of that issue (rebase does not exist in TFS).  And SVN is just the worst of both worlds.","Work with Microsoft to get solutions to issues like this http://tinyurl.com/y98qaz2m and other Git functionality that is commonly used.  Also, I have moved everything to BitBucket because I can have free private repos, you charge for that.  Although I agree that sharing knowledge is great, there are times that I would prefer to keep something private.  As a family man I do not have any spare $$ so I searched out an alternative.  P.S.  TFSOnline also allows private repos and has the option of git style or tfs style. ","Please do not take the above as a negative review.  I love the tools on your site such as gitter, gist, and the PR tools."

Any challenge or problem encountered would be the same irregardless of the company/project that hosts the content.,"Maybe a completely separate platform that is focus on social learning. Again, there is nothing GitHub centric about version control or project issue tracking that significantly impacts learning different from other methods.","The survey felt dispaportional to my use case. I saw a project that looked neat and simply forked it. Maybe played with it for a few hours and then moved on. It wasn't like I actively was seeking out course material on GitHub.
