Maybe some github-based service like travis/binder/rtfd that takes a repo and some formatting and converts it into a course page or something. This kind of something: http://cornercode.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/edx-1-large.jpg .

For  a dream example, this - https://github.com/yandexdataschool/Practical_RL/tree/master/week4 - into a unit with reading/video sections and 3 small coding assignments.

Not only this would make it easier for learners to participate, it would also make it simple to detect & fix points where learners struggle.

p.s. and yeah, i know, developing such a service would be a whole lot of work for only a small section of github community. Just dreamin'",
